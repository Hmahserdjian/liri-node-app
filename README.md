# liri-node-app

nothing much happens this was pretty hard for me. i can call only one type artist if i hard code it in. twitter isnt working at all. i tried grabbing the code from the twitter docs and twitter npm. the rest i didnt have time to get to.

C:\Users\Shoon Sha NortE\Documents\UCF\sandBox\liri-node-app\liri.js:1
(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { import { runInThisContext } from "vm"; this error i got when i tried to to node anything nothing worked to fix there was a example i tried and still nothing.
